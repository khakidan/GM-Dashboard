Referenced from the root [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md). File-by-file inventory of the codebase, organized by architectural layer (see the layer dependency rules in root AGENTS.md).

- `src/index.css` — Global stylesheet. Note that the sleek-modern block is now structural-only (font, radius, shadows, button interactions). All parchment/gold override rules have been removed.

---

## src/lib/

- `constants.ts` — `OVERLAY_DURATIONS`, `ANIMATION_TIMING`, `SHEET_RANGES`, `WRITE_QUEUE`, `STORAGE_KEYS`, `TIMERS`, `MOODS`, `AUDIO`, `campaignKey()` helper
- `sheetSchemas.ts` — Zod validation for each sheet row. Defines defaults for every column. NPC schema covers 25 columns (0–24).
- `sheetAdapters.ts` — Maps raw row arrays from the API into typed model objects.
- `sheetSyncParser.ts` — Validates full campaign workbooks on initial sync. Includes `parseConditions` and `parseSpells` functions alongside `parseNPCs`.
- `combatLogic.ts` — HP/damage/healing math, IRV application, health status calculation.
- `combatLog.ts` — Generates readable Markdown transcripts from structured combat events. Also exports shared `ACTION_TYPE_LABELS`.
- `combatantBuilder.ts` — Pure function that builds combatant state from characters + NPCs + encounterCombatants. Combatant type includes class, level, abilityScores, proficiencies, and all 8 NPC stat block fields (speed, senses, languages, challengeRating, traits, actions, reactions, legendaryActionsList) passed through from the NPC source. Includes `buildSingleNpcCombatant()` helper for adding NPC instances to combat.
- `classResources.ts` — `CLASS_RESOURCE_SUGGESTIONS` mapping for all 13 standard 5e classes and `getClassResourceSuggestions()`. Includes Rogue (Sneak Attack d6), updated Paladin (Lay on Hands), and updated Warlock (Warlock Spell Slots, short rest). Pools that unlock after level 1 (Ki Points, Sorcery Points, Action Surge, Channel Divinity) are absent from level 1 suggestions and appear automatically via `getResourcePoolSuggestions()` on level up. Returns deep-copied `ResourcePool[]` suggestions. Returns `[]` for unknown/custom classes (e.g. Vitalist).
- `hitDice.ts` — Hit dice parsing, spending, recovery. Includes `CLASS_HIT_DIE_MAP`.
- `resourcePools.ts` — `ResourcePool` interface (`{ name, current, max, reset }`), parse/serialize/spend/recover/reset/add/remove/update. Includes `EFFECT_RESOURCE_MAP` for auto-decrement when effects are applied. Note: the rest field is named `reset` (not `restoreOn`).
- `resourcePoolScaling.ts` — Level-based resource pool scaling. Exports `ResourcePoolSuggestion`, `POOL_LEVEL_TABLES` (covering Rage, Ki Points, Sorcery Points, Action Surge, Channel Divinity, Lay on Hands, Warlock Spell Slots, and Sneak Attack (d6)), `getAutoScaledMax()`, and `getResourcePoolSuggestions()`. All values follow D&D 5e 2014 rules. Used by `LevelUpDialog` to pre-fill pool max suggestions when a character levels up. Returns both scaled existing pools and new pools the character should gain.
- `spellcasting.ts` — Spellcasting utilities. Exports `SpellcastingAbility` (`'STR'|'DEX'|'CON'|'INT'|'WIS'|'CHA'|null`), `SPELLCASTING_ABILITY_MAP` (12 classes), `CLASS_SAVING_THROW_MAP` (mapping each class to its two PHB saving throw proficiencies), `getAutoSpellcastingAbility()`, `getEffectiveSpellcastingAbility()`, `calculateSpellSaveDC()`, and `calculateSpellAttackBonus()`. Ability score keys are uppercase (`STR`, `DEX`, etc.) to match `AbilityScores`.
- `concentrationCheck.ts` — `concentrationCheckDc()`, `isConcentrating()`, `fireConcentrationAlert()`.
- `conditionDefinitions.ts` — `CONDITION_MECHANICS` booleans for every condition.
- `conditionDescriptions.ts` — Official D&D 5e rules text for 35+ conditions and effects. Powers the `ConditionPopover` component.

- `irvOptions.ts` — `CONDITION_OPTIONS`, `EFFECT_OPTIONS`, `CONCENTRATION_EFFECTS`, `CONDITION_IMMUNITY_MAP`, `IRV_OPTIONS`.
- `abilityScores.ts` — `AbilityScores` and `Proficiencies` types, `calculateModifier()`, `proficiencyBonusFromLevel()`, `proficiencyBonusFromCR()`, skill/save helpers, parse/serialize helpers. `Proficiencies` includes optional `spellcastingAbility?: SpellcastingAbility` for GM override of auto-derived caster stat and optional `toughFeat?: boolean` (defaulting to `false` in `DEFAULT_PROFICIENCIES`).
- `audioFileStore.ts` — IndexedDB persistence for audio blobs, scoped per campaign.
- `diceRoller.ts` — Parses dice notation (e.g. `1d20+5`) and generates results.
- `utils.ts` — `tailwind-merge` helper.

### src/components/auth/

- `AuthPortalSettings.tsx` — Authentication portal configuration UI.
- `AuthRelay.tsx` — OAuth relay handler.

### src/components/ui/ (shared components)

- `CardNumberInput.tsx` — Local-state wrapper for numeric inline edit fields on character and NPC cards. Commits on blur or Enter and reverts to the last valid value if cleared without entering a number. Used by `CharacterCardExpanded` and `NpcCard`. Same editing pattern as `AbilityScoreInput`, but without the 1–30 clamp and with a configurable fallback value.
- `ConditionChips.tsx` — Condition/effect chip input with popover, immunity checking, timer prompts, and `onConditionAdded` callback for resource auto-decrement.
- `ConditionPopover.tsx` — Hover popover showing official rules text for any condition or effect.
- `IrvMultiSelect.tsx` — Compact multi-select for resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities.
- `IrvSection.tsx` — Shared resistances/immunities/vulnerabilities section component. Accepts `resistances`/`immunities`/`vulnerabilities`/`onUpdate` plus explicit `labels`, `placeholders`, optional `gap` (default `gap-4`), and optional `compact?: boolean`. See decomposition-log.md for the consolidation history.
- `StatBlock.tsx` — Orchestrator (117 lines). Delegates rendering to `StatBlockScores.tsx`, `StatBlockSaves.tsx`, `StatBlockPassive.tsx`, and `StatBlockSkills.tsx`. All five live in `src/components/ui/`.
- `NpcFormFields.tsx` — Shared form fields used by both `NewNpcDialog` and the `AddCombatantDialog` Create NPC tab. Must stay in sync between both usages. Contains internal four-tab navigation (Identity, Combat, Abilities, Stat Block) while keeping the external API (`data`, `onChange`, `errors`, `compact`) unchanged. Includes text fields (name, AC, HP, notes, IRV, CR, speed, senses, languages) and four list editors (traits, actions, reactions, legendary actions) using `NpcListEditor`. `rechargeAbilities` has been removed from `NpcFormData`, `DEFAULT_NPC_FORM_DATA`, and associated handlers. Recharge is now represented only by the `recharge` field on `NpcAction`.
- `NpcListEditor.tsx` — Generic list editor used by `NpcFormFields` for traits, actions, reactions, and legendary actions. Generic over `T extends { name: string }`. Entries render through a `renderFields` prop and include Add/Remove controls.
- `NpcStatBlockSection.tsx` — Pure display component for one NPC stat block section (traits, actions, reactions, or legendary actions). Accepts a `title` and `items[]` with optional metadata. Also exports `formatActionMeta(action)` to build a compact mechanical summary string from `NpcAction` fields (`attackBonus`, `damage`, `saveDC`, `saveType`, `range`, `recharge`). Returns `null` when empty.
- `ResourcePoolsSection.tsx` — Shared pip tracker UI used by both `CharacterCardExpanded` (Party tab) and `CombatantCardExpanded` (Active Encounter tab).
- `SpellcastingStatsRow.tsx` — Displays Spell Save DC and Spell Attack Bonus inline on character and NPC cards. When `onOverrideChange` is supplied (Party tab, NPC Library), renders a spellcasting ability override dropdown. When omitted (Active Encounter), renders read-only. Non-casters with no override return `null`.
- `DebouncedInput.tsx` — Standard debounced input (light parchment theme).
- `DebouncedTextarea.tsx` — Standard debounced textarea (light parchment theme).
- `DialogShell.tsx` — Shared modal shell component (backdrop + panel, optional title/icon/footer slots, `dismissOnBackdropClick` prop). Built but not yet adopted — see decomposition-log.md.

### src/components/PartyTab/

- `CharacterResourceSection.tsx` — Condition chips with `onConditionAdded` that automatically decrement matching resource pools.
- `hooks/useParty.ts` — Character CRUD plus `handleLongRest` and `handleShortRest`, both of which reset resource pools appropriately. Module-level pure helpers: `calculateLongRestUpdates`, `calculateShortRestUpdates`, `withDefaultCombatState`, `mirrorCharacterFieldsToCombatants` — see decomposition-log.md for the extraction history.
- `LevelUpDialog.tsx` — Level-up flow. Writes `level`, `class`, `hitDiceConfig`, `maxHp`, `currentHp`, `ac`, `passivePerception`, `resistances`, `immunities`, `vulnerabilities`, `notes`, `proficiencies`, and `resourcePools`. HP increase is entered as a dice roll rather than a Max HP total. CON modifier is auto-added with helper text. Tough feat checkbox persists `toughFeat: boolean` in the proficiencies JSON. Resource Pools display pre-filled scaling suggestions via `getResourcePoolSuggestions()`, editable before confirmation. Newly gained pools can be individually included or excluded.
- `NewPlayerDialog.tsx` — Four-tab character creation form. All Identity tab inputs now include proper `id` and `htmlFor` attributes for accessibility.

### src/components/ActiveEncounterTab/

- `index.tsx` — Top-level coordinator. Owns `characters`/`npcs` derivation for combatants (resolves `pcCharacter`/`npcModel` once per combatant in its `.map()`, passing resolved data down — see decomposition-log.md).
- `CombatHeader.tsx` — Encounter controls. Includes **End Encounter** (writes log) and **Cancel Encounter** (discards log, destructive style).
- `CombatantCard.tsx` — Pure prop-driven card; receives `combatStarted`, `pcCharacter`, `npcModel` as props (no direct store access).
- `CombatantCardHeader.tsx` — Compact `[-] N/M [+]` resource counter row for every PC resource pool in collapsed view. Passes through a resolved `pcCharacter` prop to `CombatantCompactResourceRow`.
- `CombatantCardExpanded.tsx` — Full `ResourcePoolsSection` for player combatants. Pure prop-driven (no store access).
- `CombatantCompactResourceRow.tsx` — Pure prop-driven (receives `character` prop, no store access).
- `GlobalActionContextPanel.tsx` — Global Source/Type context panel displayed when combat is active (`combatStarted: true`). Pure prop-driven (no store access).
- `AddCombatantDialog.tsx` — Modal for adding a combatant to the active encounter (renamed from `CombatSidebar.tsx`, which was a misnomer — it renders as a centered modal, not a sidebar). Three tabs: `library` (pick an existing NPC from the NPC library, set quantity), `party` (pick existing active party members not already in the encounter), `create` (build a brand-new NPC via the shared `NpcFormFields` component and add it directly). The dialog's own header reads "Add Combatant," which the new filename now matches.
- `NpcReferencePanel.tsx` — Collapsible NPC stat block reference displayed on NPC combatants during encounters. Manages its own expanded state. Hidden when the combatant has no stat block data. Toggle text is `"▶ Stat Block"` / `"▼ Stat Block"`. Displays CR, speed, senses, languages, and all four `NpcStatBlockSection` lists. Imports both `NpcStatBlockSection` and `formatActionMeta`.
- `CombatMechanicsSummary.tsx` — Pure presentational component showing combat mechanics (speed restrictions, advantage/disadvantage, auto-fail warnings) from a `mechanicalSummary` object. No store access.
- `CombatantIrvDisplay.tsx` — Read-only display for combatant resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities.
- `hooks/useDeathSaves.ts` — Death saving throw state and stabilization logic.
- `hooks/useCombatantExpanded.ts` — Encapsulates resource pool updates and condition-triggered resource depletion via `onConditionAdded`. Used by `CombatantCardExpanded`.
- `hooks/useHealthChange.ts` — Damage/healing with IRV math. Fires `fireConcentrationAlert()` whenever a concentrating combatant takes damage.
- `hooks/useCombatSync.ts` (66 lines) — Turn, round, and combatant synchronization facade. Calls `initCombatLog`, `addCombatEvent`, `advanceCombatLogRound`, and `clearCombatLog`. Implements initiative sorting on first turn, dead-NPC skipping, and NPC initiative as `1d20 + DEX modifier`. Delegates core behaviors to `useCombatantMutations`, `useCombatLifecycle`, `useCombatTurn`, and `useCombatConcentration` internally and re-exposes their APIs.
- `hooks/useCombatantMutations.ts` — Extracted from `useCombatSync`. Contains `updateCombatant`, `removeCombatant`, and `syncingIds`. Handles PC/NPC HP, conditions, and AC-modifier updates with DB writes (using `updateCharacterDB`, `updateNpcInstanceHpDB`, etc.), includes rollback on failure, and emits combat log events for condition changes.
- `hooks/useCombatLifecycle.ts` — Extracted from `useCombatSync`. Contains `resetCombat`, `cancelCombat`, `rollInitForNPCs`, and `handleCallInitiative`. Handles initiative rolling for NPCs, resetting and canceling active combat encounters with database persistence and rollback, and combat log start/end emissions.
- `hooks/useCombatTurn.ts` — Extracted from `useCombatSync`. Contains `nextTurn` (turn/round advancement, dead-NPC skipping via `getNextActiveTurnIndex`, first-turn initiative finalization, legendary action resets, death save prompts, expired condition removal), receiving `updateCombatant` via dependency injection rather than calling `useCombatantMutations()` internally.
- `hooks/useCombatConcentration.ts` — Extracted from `useCombatSync`. Contains local React state `concentrationPrompt` and handlers `handleConcentrationPrompt`/`handleSelectCaster`, receiving `updateCombatant` via dependency injection rather than calling `useCombatantMutations()` internally.
- `hooks/useEncounterPresetLoader.ts` — Handles adding PC and NPC presets to active encounters. Implements rollback fix: state snapshots are now captured BEFORE optimistic updates (not after), so a failed DB write correctly rolls back to pre-update state and shows a toast.error to the GM.
- `hooks/useEncounterKeyboard.ts` — Global combat keyboard shortcuts. Escape exits selection mode, clears `expandedIds`, and closes modals.

### src/components/EncountersTab/

- `EncounterCard.tsx` — Pure prop-driven card; receives `encounterCombatants` and `difficulties` as props (no direct store access).
- `hooks/useEncounterLogs.ts` — On-demand hook for `EncounterLogs` sheet data. Not part of global Zustand sync. Exposes `fetchLogsForEncounter()` (returns logs filtered by encounter, newest first) and `deleteLog()`.

### src/components/NpcLibraryTab/

- `NpcCard.tsx` — NPC library card. Expanded view displays `StatBlock`, `SpellcastingStatsRow`, editable combat stats (AC, HP, IRV, etc.), and read-only stat block sections (CR, speed, senses, languages, traits, actions, reactions, legendary actions) via `NpcStatBlockSection`.
- `NewNpcDialog.tsx` — NPC creation dialog using the shared `NpcFormFields` component.
